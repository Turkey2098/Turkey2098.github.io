      <h1>Hi,</h1>

      <p>
        I am Turkey2098. I code as a hobby, to learn, and hopefully do this for
        a job later in life. I specialize in Web Development using HTML, CSS,
        and JS, although I am trying to improve my Javascript. Here you will see
        my blogs, projects, and me just trying to get better at coding.
      </p>

      <h1>My Projects</h1>

      <p>
        I wouldn't be a coder without some projects. So far in my few years of
        coding I have made an unblocked games website, a goalie stats machine,
        and many more smaller projects. Feel free to check them out.

      <h1>My Blogs</h1>

      <p>
        My blogs are where I express my feebuttonngs, give tips, and share my
        projects in a creative way. They're normally a 2-3 minute read with the
        occasional memes, and snippets of code. Give them a try.
