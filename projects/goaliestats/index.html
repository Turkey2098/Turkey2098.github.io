    <h1>Goalie Stats Machine</h1>

    <h2>A Hockey Goalie Stats Taker</h2>

      Goalie Stats Machine was my first web-based coding project that I made in
      the 1st semester of my 7th grade year. One of my friends came up to me and
      wanted to know if I knew of any goalie stats takers on the app store. I
      told him that I didn't know of any but that I could code one for him.
      Again, this was my first web-based coding project so the css and the code
      in general is a bit... iffy. And with my belief of not improving my old
      coding projects to see my improvement, it will most likely stay that way.
      In the future I may make an upgraded version of this, but for know it
      works, just lacking in the css department.
