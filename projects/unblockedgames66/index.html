      Unblocked Games 66 was a project I worked on through the 2nd semester of
      my 8th grade year. The Idea behind this was to as well as I could, copy
      the unblocked games websites that were created on the classic google
      sites. I wanted to do this because all of those games websites were going
      out-of-date with the conclusion of flash and the introduction of the new
      google sites. If you want to learn more about it you can check my blog.
