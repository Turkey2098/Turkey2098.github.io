    <h1>Why Dublin City Schools Feels The Need To Change Our Usernames?</h1>

    <p>Who Knows</p>

    <p>
      So I'm in 5th period, bored AF, and I get this email from the school. I do
      what any reasonable person would do and abandon everything I'm doing and
      read it. Of course I'm expecting some random weekly announcement, event,
      whatever. Not This. They're going to change our Usernames and Emails.
