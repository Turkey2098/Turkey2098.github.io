    <h1>Why Dublin City Schools Feels The Need To Change Our Usernames?</h1>

    <p>Who Knows</p>

    <p>
      So I'm in 5th period, bored AF, and I get this email from the school. I do
      what any reasonable person would do and abandon everything I'm doing and
      read it. Of course I'm expecting some random weekly announcement, event,
      whatever. Not this. They're going to change our Usernames and Emails.

    <p>
      Now, instead of your username being "graduationDatelastName_firstName"
      <br />
      It will now be "lastName.number" with that number being there for
      duplicate lastnames (higher number --&gt; more duplicates).
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine this, your emailing your friend. You type in his first and last
      name and boom, you found his email. However with the new emails, it isn't
      as easy. This time you only type in his last name because his last name
      doesn't matter, and boom you see 25 emails from Smith.1 to Smith.25. Which
      one is your friend? It is time for you to put on your thinking cap and
      solve the problem at hand.

      1. Profile pictures. You reaize that not everyone has the same profile
      picture. Smart. You start to narrow down the list but then you realize
      that your friend changed his profile picture for the 10th time this month.
      You end up narrowing down the amount of emails to 10.

      2. Teachers.
