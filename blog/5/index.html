    <h1>They Blocked Scratch?</h1>

    <p>Because when it comes to DCS, why not.</p>

      I would expect everyone to know what Scratch is. Whether you've coded
      on it for a school project, or if you've played some games on it, I bet
      you know what it is. If you don't, Scratch is normally the first step to
      coding. Most people start coding with Scratch before they move on actually
      typing their code, because of how easy it is. Instead of typing and having
      to deal with files, and spelling everything right, you can drag and drop
      little blocks of code like move forward 5 steps, or turn around 180
      degrees. Scratch is simple way to get into coding.

      Anyways on May 10th, 2022, DCS decided to do something big, something
      crazy, something never before seen, THEY BLOCKED SCRATCH!!!

    <p>
      Now, I'm not sure why they did, and I'm sure they realized their mistake
      because they unblocked it after a whole 2 hours. I have a feeling that a
      random 5th-grade teacher just trying to teach some coding and was
      reasonably confused about why it didn't work.

    <p>
      But wait, THERE'S MORE! 2 days later on May 12th, THEY BLOCKED IT AGAIN!
      And then 3 hours later, THEY UNBLOCKED IT AGAIN! I just want to know the
      district's thought process for blocking scratch twice. But at least they
      unblocked it twice as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

      Now, I was also going to write about Geogebra and all of the other Blocksi
      bypasses but to be honest, I didn't want to write that much, and Derin (He
      doesnt really have a username) already wrote about it. <a href="https://dublinschools.xyz/6/">https://dublinschools.xyz</a>
