    <h1>A Small Trick That Can Save Your Test</h1>

    <p>And I think it's not cheating?</p>

    <p class="date">5/21/2022</p>

    <p>
      We've all been there, you're taking a test and have no clue what the
      question means or how to solve it. You try to reassure yourself, saying
      that you were never taught this. But deep down, you know that you were on
      your phone playing Clash of Clans or in my case, working on my unblocked
      games site, while the subject was being taught.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like I said before, we've all been there. But the real question is, what
      are you gonna do about it. You could guess, and if you're lucky have a 25%
      chance to get it right, or you could play it smart.
    </p>

    <p>
      You see, everyone has Grammarly installed. Whether someone kept telling you
      to get it, or you installed it yourself, it doesn't matter. All that
      matters is that you have Grammarly installed. If you don't, seriously, 
      <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-grammar-checker/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen"
        >install it.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      You may know that Grammarly can fix your spelling and give you
      suggestions, but did you know that it can show definitions and synonyms?
      When you double click and highlight a word, the word's definitions and
      synonyms show.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now why does this matter? On that test, that subject, that question that
      you couldn't figure out. Those 1 in 4 odds didn't seem that appealing.
      That's when you get smart. You highlight the word and the definition pops
      up. You figure out the question, you press submit, you get 100%, you're
      not a dissapointment. Good for you. &#128077;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here's an example:
    </p>
    
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/7d1a1b38-8d2d-4542-b5ac-650c6eb984d3/Screenshot%202022-05-21%207.51.06%20PM.png?v=1653177115818">
    
    <p>
      A naive reader may ask, isn't this cheating? And at first, it may seem like
      it. But I can assure you, it's not. You see, (Dhar Man moment) Teachers
      encourage the use of Grammarly. It may seem weird at first but a teacher
      is going to want your answers written correctly with some help rather than
      constantly checking with his/her students what their words are
      supposed to mean, all because they aren't so good at spelling, in a
      science class.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other reason it's not cheating is the district can easily disable it.
      They've done it before with GeoGebra, and Spectral Analysis, and plenty of
      google add-ons have been blocked or disabled. Which raises the question,
      why isn't Grammarly blocked? And the reason is simple, Grammarly is so
      helpful that a small problem isn't worth blocking Grammarly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So there you have it. A helpful way to save a test, that I would argue is not cheating.
