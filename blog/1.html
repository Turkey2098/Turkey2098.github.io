    <h1>Creating Your Own Unblocked Games Website</h1>

      If you haven't been living under a rock for the past 5-10 years, you've
      seen one of these unblocked games websites:

      While they may look complex, they are actually just google sites. The only
      problem though is that those webistes can't be created anymore. In 2016,
      Google presented the new google sites. Ever since, users have slowly
      shifted to the newer, nicer, neater version. In May 2021, the creation of
      classic sites was disabled, and in December 2021, editing classic sites
      was disabled. All of this, combined with the end of flash in 2021, means
      that classic google sites are slowly going out-of-date.
