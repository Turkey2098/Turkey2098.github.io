    <h1>Creating Your Own Unblocked Games Website</h1>

      If you haven't been living under a rock for the past 5-10 years, you've
      seen one of these unblocked games websites:

      While they may look complex, they are actually just google sites. The only
      problem though is that those webistes can't be created anymore. In 2016,
      Google presented the new google sites. Ever since, users have slowly
      shifted to the newer, nicer, neater version. In May 2021, the creation of
      classic sites was disabled, and in December 2021, editing classic sites
      was disabled. All of this, combined with the end of flash in 2021, means
      that classic google sites are slowly going out-of-date.

      Now what does that have to do with most unblocked games websites? As I
      mentioned before, all the game webistes that you have played were made
      using classic google sites. So, as games get blocked, stop working, or
      change URLs, these websites can't keeing adding, removing, changing, and
      fixing their website.

      You might wonder, "Why can't you just use the new google sites?" Although
      it may be good for making informational websites, there are not enough
      tabs or pages in the navbar to fit the 100+ games needed for a game
      website.

      In christmas-ish time last year I had this exact problem but on the
      consumer end, there were no games for me to play. And so over the course
      of a half a year I, with help from some of my friends coded an unblocked
      games website. It looks exactly like the classic ones but still able to be
      edited, and added on to, to keep up with the lastest games. Here is a little picture of it
