    <h2>Repl:</h2>

    <p>
      If anyone doesn't know, Repl is a IDE (Integrated Development
      Enviornment). Repl was the first coding website that the coders at my
      school used. It lived a reasonably long life of about 9 months, but that
      changed when it got blocked for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Febuary 12th, 2021, any URL ending in .repl.co was wifi blocked. Now
      this wasn't that big of deal because it happened when we were hybrid
      learning. Remember Covid?
    </p>

    <!--repl, glitch <-- my fault, spectral analysis, the calculator app, ipevo, scratch - May 10, scratch again - May 12-->
