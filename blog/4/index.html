    <h1>Blocked Websites</h1>

    <p>A timeline of all blocked websites in DCS</p>

    <p class="date">5/13/2022</p>

    <h2>Repl:</h2>

    <p>
      If anyone doesn't know, Repl is a IDE (Integrated Development
      Enviornment). Repl was the first coding website that the coders at my
      school used. It lived a reasonably long life of about 9 months, but that
      changed when it got blocked for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Febuary 12th, 2021, any URL ending in .repl.co was wifi blocked. Now
      this wasn't that big of deal because it happened when we were hybrid
      learning. Remember Covid? So I wait till the next day when we do in-school
      learning to ask them if they had the same issue, but when I go to show
      them, Repl.It was blocked. And our projects ending in .repl.co weren't
      blocked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now I'm getting a bit worried because I've got an english project on Repl and I can't work on it
    </p>

    <h2>Scratch:</h2>

    <p>
      I would expect everyone would know what scratch is. Whether you've coded
      on it for a school project, or if you've played some games on it, I bet
      you know what it is. If you don't, Scratch is normally the first step to
      coding. Most people start coding with Scratch first, because of how easy
      it is. Instead of typing and having to deal with files, and spelling
      everything right, you can drag and drop little blocks of code like, Move
      forward 5 steps, or turn around 180 degrees. It is normally the first step
      to coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyways on May 10th, 2022, DCS decided to do something big, somthing
      crazy, something never before seen, THEY BLOCKED SCRATCH!!!
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://cdn.glitch.global/7d1a1b38-8d2d-4542-b5ac-650c6eb984d3/download%20(5).png?v=1652451080727"
    />

    <p>
      Now, I'm not sure why they did. And I'm sure they realized there mistake
      because they unblocked it after a whole 2 hours. I have a feeling that a
      random 5th grade teacher just trying to teach some coding and was
      reasonably confused why it didn't work.
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait, THERE'S MORE! 2 days later on May 12th, THEY BLOCKED IT AGAIN!
      And then 3 hours later, THEY UNBLOCKED IT AGAIN! I just wanna know the
      districts thought process for blocking scratch twice. But at least they
      unblocked it twice as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>

    <!--repl, glitch <-- my fault, spectral analysis, the calculator app, ipevo, scratch - May 10, scratch again - May 12-->
