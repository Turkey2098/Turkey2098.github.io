    <p>A timeline of all blocked websites in DCS</p>

    <p class="date">5/13/2022</p>

    <h2>Repl:</h2>

    <p>
      If anyone doesn't know, Repl is a IDE (Integrated Development
      Enviornment). Repl was the first coding website that the coders at my
      school used. It lived a reasonably long life of about 9 months, but that
      changed when it got blocked for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Febuary 12th, 2021, any URL ending in .repl.co was wifi blocked. Now
      this wasn't that big of deal because it happened when we were hybrid
      learning. Remember Covid?
    </p>

    <h2>Scratch:</h2>

    <p>
      I would expect everyone would know what scratch is. Whether you've coded
      on it for a school project, or if you've played some games on it, I bet
      you know what it is. If you don't, Scratch is normally the first step to
      coding. Most people start coding with Scratch first, because of how easy
      it is. Instead of typing and having to deal with files, and spelling
      everything right, you can drag and drop little blocks of code like, Move
      forward 5 steps, or turn around 180 degrees. It is normally the first step
      to coding.
