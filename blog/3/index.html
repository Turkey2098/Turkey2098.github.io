    <h1>Why Dublin City Schools Feels The Need To Change Our Emails?</h1>

    <p>Who Knows</p>

    <p class="date">5/2/2022</p>

    <p>
      So I'm in 5th period, bored AF, and I get this email from the school. I do
      what any reasonable person would do and abandon everything I'm doing and
      read it. Of course, I'm expecting some random weekly announcement, event,
      whatever. Not this. They're going to change our Usernames and Emails.
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      Now, instead of your username being "graduationDateLastName_firstName"
      <br />
      It will now be "lastName.number" with that number being there for
      duplicate last names (higher number --&gt; more duplicates). It may look
      better, but I can assure you, shorter does not mean better. Here's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine this, your emailing your friend. You type in his first and last
      name and boom, you found his email. However with the new emails, it isn't
      as easy. This time you only type in his last name because his first name
      doesn't matter, and boom you see 25 emails from Smith.1 to Smith.25. Which
      one is your friend? It is time for you to put on your thinking cap and
      solve the problem at hand.
    </p>

      1. Profile pictures. You reaize that not everyone has the same profile
      picture. Smart. You start to narrow down the list but then you realize
      that your friend changed his profile picture for the 15th time this month.
      You end up narrowing down the number of emails to 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Teachers. All of the teachers have different domain names than
      students do. You narrow the number of emails down to 8.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. You come up with a solution. You decide to wait for the end of the day
      and ask him on the bus what his email is. He tells you his email is
      Smith.23@dublinstudents.net. You feel so accomplished. You get off the bus
      and run home, so excited. You pull out your computer, start writing your
      email, and then it hits you. You could've just told him in person.
    </p>

    <p>
      I realize that this would never happen and if for some reason you are
      still reading this you are thinking, "This idiot wrote a whole story about
      some random email change." The only two reasons I wrote this in a story
      format is 1, I thought it would be funnier to share my thoughts this way
      and 2, today's wordle was "story". Sorry for spoilers.

      To contrast what I said at the start, there is a good reason for this
      email change. And that is for better organization and for duplicate names.
      The only reason I wrote this blog post about something this stupid is
      because like I said earlier, 5th period is unbelievably boring.

    <p>
      So uh, thanks for reading I guess. I hope you enjoyed reading an idiot
      complain about the stupidest thing ever.

    <p>Goodbye.</p>
